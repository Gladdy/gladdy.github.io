<p>
  I enjoy building things. I really enjoy solving problems.
</p>

<p>
  Starting out with fixing bicycle bells at age 4 to building a fully functional, remote-controlled sailboat from scratch at age 13 <a href="http://s278.photobucket.com/user/Martijn95/Lelievlet/story">(click)</a> I've always been building things. Even though just aimlessly building things is great, I realized that it is much more fun to build things that solve real problems, which are experienced by actual people and have a significant impact.
</p>

<p>
  The advent of digital technology and the Internet has reduced the entry barrier for the creation of impactful solutions to next to nothing. It has never been easier to develop a website that can be used by thousands of people. However, each and every problem encountered may require a different approach which is 10x better than the others.
</p>

<p>
  It is my quest to find those 10x solutions.

  I'm currently studying Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. In my spare time, when I'm not busy solving problems, I enjoy 3D modelling, animation and playing the bassoon.
