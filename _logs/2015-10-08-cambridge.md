This has been quite a long week. So long actually that I had to look up what I had done every day, but lets start at the beginning and where I left of, Saturday October 3rd.

## Matriculation
Officially becoming a member of the university. Its a very fancy name for a very fancy event that basically boils down to writing down your name on a piece of paper. They tell you that you put your name in the same book as all previous members of the university have done - however it was a printed A4 sheet so I highly doubt that. But still, you become an official member of the university and your college. Furthermore, they take your picture and a group picture of everyone wearing a suit and a gown. It looks both ridiculous and nice. I haven't deciced yet what prevails. After the matriculation events (which took about an hour), we went for tea (getting used to milk in tea by now) to The Eagle (the pub where Watson & Crick first announced that they had found 'the secret of life', DNA) which was followed up by a tour around the college and its two libraries. The college has both an old part, which looks very pretty, especially at dusk and a new part, mostly invisible from the outside (street), which is mostly just functional. The new library looks just like any reasonably modern library - the only difference is is that the bookcases are arranged in a somewhat weird pattern, almost like a maze. Anyway, the old library (also known as the Sherlock library, which might be a reference to how hard it is to find) is the pretty one. It looks like it has not changed in the last 300 years or so. Unfortunately, this mainly houses books on literature and other non-sciency subjects so I doubt I'll spend much time there.

After the tours we briefly visited the Fitzwilliam museum (considered to be the finest small museum in Europe) and the museum of the Scott Polar Research Institute, where they display the actual notes taken by Scott during his fatal trip on Antarctica.

We got tired of poncing around in gowns, got changed and played football, which is quite straightforward considering we've got the entire sports grounds of Catz (abbreviation for St. Catharine's College) right next door, which contains football, rugby, tennis and cricket pitches.

The evening was filled with the matriculation reception - loads of opportunities to talk to fellow freshers and other people who've been around quite a bit longer already.

So that was a single day - don't worry, the next days were not nearly as long.

## The rest of the week
Last week was riddled with introduction events for international students, this week was filled with introduction events organized by the MCR (middle combination room, the group of graduate students. Alongside this you have the JCR for (junior) undergraduates and the SCR (senior) for fellows, but I digress.). We went for a treasure hunt around Cambridge (for which it was quite helpful to have a PhD student in the team who apparently quite a bit already on Cambridge), a board game night in the MCR, a fair presenting all the Catz societies, punting (pretty fun, but also exhausting when the 3 other people can't really do it and you only find out when you have gone halfway yourself), a pizza + film night and more general parties.

The general student union did still organize things, mainly the freshers fair, where all university societies present themselves to you. I think I have walked by a few hundred stands in total. Left my email address at quite a few too so if there is anything interesting going on I'll probably know about it.

Furthermore, there were introductions organized by the department - funnily enough one of the first things they mentioned was 'please sign up for a PhD', even before the actual course had even started. Also, the General Safety events were actually sort of entertaining because they mostly consisted of stories on how previous students had messed up. And they took less than an hour.

## It actually started
Introduction activities are fun and all, but the real work also started this week. The professors are great - as could probably be expected, but in large scale lectures you do not notice so much of this (I attended a large lecture on Computer Vision, even though I haven't chosen that course). Where it does shine is in small sessions, in which the lecture format shifts to a dialogue format between the professor and the students, loosely guided by the slides. They do not care too much if they digress - they have more interest in your questions than the content which is actually on the lecture slides.

The dialog approach also means that your understanding of the topic becomes much more rigorous. Rigorousness in general is also a characterisation of the courses here. My experience with CompSci in Twente was mostly that it was courses on learning how to do a specific thing, be it learn a programming language or process some data in a specific way. The courses here seem much more based in mathematically rigorous. Learning to program or performing a specific task is something you should really pick up on the side. They teach you the underlying mechanisms in definitions and methods which are as formal as possible which is very useful as you can apply your knowledge immediately to other fields, which is something that was somewhat lacking in the Dutch system of CompSci education.


So that was the first real week. This text has not been reread or edited in any way so I'm sure there are loads of mistakes present. I'm getting tired now and my battery is dying so this is going to be all for this week. Until next time.
