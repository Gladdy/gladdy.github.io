It has been requested multiple times that I keep some kind of log of my experiences over here for the people back home or whoever else that might be interested in the life of an MPhil student at the University of Cambridge.

I arrived here a week ago - not really knowing what to expect. Knowing your way around town is one of the first requirements for getting familiar with the place and the people, hence that's what I did. Simply walking and cycling around, I did not not quite know where I was going to end up at first but quickly a mental map of Cambridge started to form which appeared to be quite useful later on, finding the locations of introduction activities. Apart from familiarizing yourself with the city - getting to know the surroundings can also be fun. This can be done by bike, however, as the cycling lane counts in England are slim compared to Holland, a better way might just be to go by car. My parents were still around, enjoying their 5-day mini-vacation with the purpose of exploring the English countryside, so I joined them on trips over twisty rural roads to Ely and St. Ives. After they left the real introduction activities were scheduled to commence.

Several different bodies have organised introduction activities: the student union (CUSU), the international branch of the student union (iCUSU), the department you are going to be studying at (in my case the Computer Laboratory) and to top it off your college is also organizing all kinds of different activities, some for all new students but also some especially for graduate students. One might wonder - what is a college, what does it do and why is it a great system for universities but those questions will probably be featured in some later log entry. Considering the vast amount of different activities you can participate in, of which some overlap, I just put everything on my Google Calendar and try to participate in as much as possible - partially succumbing to [FOMO](http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/columns/0033131-memoirs-of-an-insecure-fresher-when-fomo-takes-over.html).

The activities range from punting to garden parties to pizza nights and pub crawls, too many to name. However up to now I spoken to people from: England, Wales, Scotland, France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Botswana, India, Malaysia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, USA, Canada and Brazil. Quite possibly I'm omitting some countries by accident. Furthermore, another nice thing about the general introductions by (i)CUSU is that you meet people from a wide range of different colleges. The first question when you meet someone new always covers their name, college and subject.

After spending a single week here are two key adjectives that come to mind - awesome and weird, of which the latter will be elaborated on in my next log.
