This log entry will have 3 parts: Elaborating on how this university system is somewhat strange, the concept of formal dinners and the courses I'm taking.

## Weirdness (inconsistency)
The barrier to entry to this place is rather high. You should have done well in both academic work and extracurricular activities - which I believe everybody studying here has. One would expect that in order to perform well at either task, be it school or leisure related the basic foundation is that you are able to look after yourself because an important part of studying is becoming an adult. Living on your own, cooking your own food, doing your own laundry and cleaning your own room or house. Therefore, you would expect that people who are good at doing all kinds of different activities got the basics covered.

But no. Even though people have towering expectations of you when it comes to academics or sports or music - the colleges sort of assume that you are not quite capable of living on your own. Somebody comes into your room every day to empty your trash bin. Toilets, shared with 3 others, cleaned every day. Every week someone comes by to vacuum your room. Don't get me wrong - I'm not complaining. It's just a rather sharp contrast with my experiences back in Enschede.

As for cooking. We do have a kitchen. It's probably a bit over square meters, including counter space. It's not quite enough if 6 people want to cook dinner at the same time (cooking for eachother every day is not done here.), so unless you have some ready-made meal you could pop into a microwave oven or you just want to boil some pasta, cooking becomes difficult around dinner time. Furthermore, the seemingly ever growing stacks of dirty dishes take up around half of the available counter space - You'd almost start to miss the kitchen in Enschede, in which there were simply not enough utensils, plates and mugs available to fill up any significant fraction of the counter. In short - cooking can be hard, but it is perfectly in line with the college being there to look after you: in Hall they serve 3 meals a day, no hassle, no dishes.

## Gowned up
Speaking about Hall - this is also where formal dinners take place. The concept of regular (multiple times per week) formal dinners, for which you have to dress up (full suit + tie + gown) seems old-fashioned and that's because it is. It's what you get at a university which is ~800 years old. You don't have to go to every single formal, some are especially for undergratuates, some are only for graduates and some others are for special occassions. However, so far I've gone to 3. It's just fun. You talk to some new people and the food is pretty good (especially the matriculation formal). Anyway, as with most things over here they're quite heavily rooted in history and therefore religion. Every formal starts with a preprandial prayer in Latin, read by the Chaplain or a classics student. Afterwards you are not allowed to leave your seat any more until after dessert. This is followed by a postprandial prayer, cheese plates and coffee/tea.

This week Thursday after the formal they had something called 'Evening songs' in the college chapel, which looks nice, fits about 50 people and even has an organ. A college choir gave a little concert - again, the roots in history and religion are still very visible. Even though I do not quite believe the Chaplain in his sermons, it's still calming, it sounds nice and I'll probably go again next time.

## Sort of the main reason I came here
One part in which historical roots are not quite so visible anymore (you just have to look harder as they're still there, first stored-program computer, EDSAC, built here in 1946), is in the courses I'm currently taking. Succinctly enumerating them:

* Advanced Computer Design - Essentially the development of processors. Part of this course is similar to what I have done for my undergraduate thesis but this has quite a lot more depth.
* Multicore Semantics and Programming - Short version: current multicore processors kind of broken. There are no rigorous descriptions of their behaviour which makes it very hard to write multithreaded optimizations. What to do about this.
* Modern Compiler Construction - Getting work done on LLVM, which is a 500.000+ line of code project intended to transform the code you type into the code the machine can execute in some efficient way.
* Advanced Operating Systems - In an undergraduate course on operating systems you'll get the impression that OSs are quite easy to construct. Until you have to deal with actual hardware. The course is mostly on performance tracing and understanding real operating systems.

Additional courses (I'm just sitting in on even though I do not have to):

* Computer Vision - transforming 2D images into 3D objects etc. Features quite a bit of machine learning.
* Geometric Algebra - Hardcore applied mathematics. All kinds of operations on vectors and quaternions. Features objects like bivectors, n-vectors, pseudoscalars and sort-of cross products in arbitrary (n>2) dimensions. Practical applications are in physical simulations, which require a cheap representation of rotations instead of an expensive matrix multiplication (especially when n gets large).
