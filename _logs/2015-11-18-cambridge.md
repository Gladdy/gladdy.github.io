I have not been writing quite as much as I would have hoped to in the past week or two. Actually, I have been writing quite a bit, lab reports, essays and research proposals, but those are not quite relevant for this blog. A phenomenon called week 5 blues, as that is when deadlines for assignments tend to be set. I handed in the work that was due this week and now I've got some more time to write a log entry.

Anyway, as by request and in order to have a slightly more visual post than previous times, it is going to be some annotated photos and a video. The video was only taken today, hence I have waited a bit with uploading this log entry.

## Photos
Whenever I was not only just in time for a lecture, I tried to take pictures that might be of interest. As seen from the amount of pictures below, being overly in time for lectures or other events is not something that occurs a lot (though I usually get there before it starts).

## Winter head
Actual proof that I indeed do rowing (any day of the week bar one).

In contrast to the rowing events Cambridge might be known for: the "bumps", in which you try to overtake the boat ahead of you before being overtaken by the boat behind you, this race was purely time based. That said however, we did manage to overtake two boats over the course of the race, which is ~2.6km. We ended up finishing with a time of 11:06, which is a solid 5th place amongst the novice boats and a slightly less solid 129th out of 225 overall.

Watching the entire video might be somewhat boring, but you should have a look at what happens just after 1:40. It's quite funny.
